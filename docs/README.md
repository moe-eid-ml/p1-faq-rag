# Docs entry point (read this first)

If you are an AI assistant or a contributor:

1) Read `docs/north_star.md` (project spine + non-negotiables).
2) Read `docs/prompt_guardrails.md` (how you must behave: no evidence, no claim).
3) When opening PRs, follow `.github/pull_request_template.md`.

Rules:
- If you can’t access repo files, say: `NEED FILE: <path>` and ask the user to paste it.
- Keep scope: one intent per PR. Extras go to `docs/parking-lot.md`.
